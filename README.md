#### Future Development

In the Future we thought of 
- Making it mobile friendly with a mobile interface
- We  thought about making everything apear more professional.
- We thought about adding shows. 
- Making a watched history
- Adding a feature to be able to mark something as watched. 
- Choosing which country you are watching the movie or show from. 
- Add more search filters. 
- Adding a way for us to make money... maybe a subscription.
